    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Rooted in a loving and vibrant family, every day is an adventure waiting
      to unfold. Our shared journeys have molded me into not just a traveler,
      but also an explorer of life's many wonders. When I'm not cherishing
      moments with my loved ones or venturing into new horizons, I'm immersed in
      the world of code. As a passionate programmer, I don't just see it as a
      careerâ€”it's a calling. Through every line of code, I strive to bring
      visions to life and leave a mark that lasts.
    </p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      My academic journey began in China, dedicating two years to studying
      Chemistry. However, I quickly realized it wasn't my true calling. Seeking
      my passion, I transferred to the University of Utah, diving deep into
      Computer Science with an emphasis on Game Development. Four transformative
      years later, my thirst for knowledge led me to the University of Waterloo.
      There, I earned a master's degree in ECE, focusing on software. Through it
      all, I discovered a burning passion for codingâ€”it was not just a subject,
      but a craft I had come to love. With my education complete, I embarked on
      my professional journey, eager to make my mark.
    </p>

    <h3>Life beyond the screen</h3>
    <p>
      Family is the cornerstone of my life; I hold immense love and gratitude
      for my parents. When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you'll
      likely find me with a fishing rod in hand or deeply engrossed in a
      captivating video game. And as for the future? A furry, four-legged
      companion is definitely on the horizon. I dream of days filled with
      wagging tails and playful barks.

    <p>
      Well, that's a wrap on me! As for this website, it's my digital canvas: a
      blend of tech notes, musings, and snippets from life's journey. A heads up
      though: I'm the captain of this ship, so only I get to set the sails (or,
      in simpler terms, post content). But hey, you're more than welcome to join
      the conversation in the comments.
